      "I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue with Microsoft Word.\n\nSince you've already tried restarting Microsoft Word and the issue persists, let's move on to the next steps.\n\nCan you try checking for updates for Microsoft Office by going to **File** > **Account** > **Update Options**? If there are any updates available, install them and restart Microsoft Word.\n\nAdditionally, try disabling add-ins in Microsoft Word by going to **File** > **Options** > **Add-ins**, and unchecking the boxes next to each add-in. This will help us determine if an add-in is causing the issue.\n\nIf the issue still persists, let's try opening a new, blank document in Microsoft Word to see if the freezing issue occurs with a new document. If the issue doesn't occur with a new document, it's possible that the original file is corrupt.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, we can try more advanced troubleshooting steps, such as resetting the Office configuration or reinstalling Microsoft Office.\n\nPlease try these steps and let me know the outcome, and we'll go from there."
